## Overview

### Product: Google Fit Android App

> I will be writing about the Google Fit App for Android. I will be using the [help articles](https://support.google.com/fit/) as well as the [developer documentation](https://developers.google.com/fit/overview) for reference.

### Feature: Activity Recording.

> The feature that I will be documenting is the manual activity recording. This is limited to activity records created by the user, and not by tracking by an android phone or fitness wearable. It also does not include GPS-based live activity tracking.

### Audience: Casual, non-technical users of the app.

> This guide is intended for casual, non-technical users who have already installed the app, and are not solely interested in using it with a fitness tracking wearable.

### User Goals:
- Manually add exercise activities to Google Fit records
- Review past activities
- Maintain accurate record of activities

### Style Guide: Google Documentation Style Guide

> I will be using the [Google Documentation Style Guide](https://developers.google.com/style/). Although it is primarily intended for developer-facing documentation, it in creates standards of simplicity, clarity, and international accessibility that apply equally to user-facing writing.
