
## Vocabulary

- task list
- task flow
- use case
- use-case model
- content model

## Use Cases

### How to model a task?
- flowcharts
- workflow models
- data flow diagrams

 ### Scenarios vs. Use Cases
  - They are a detailed breakdown of the former

### What are they for?

- Not intended for end-user content
- "One way" that a process can take place
- Narrative description, but not paragraph.
- one complete and meaningful interaction between user and user role and the system.

### Deriving from a Scenario

- Map them from the list of tasks listed that the user needs to be able to do
- Some tasks are subtasks of a larger one

### Task/Use Case Model/Map

- Visual Diagram of tasks with actor
- Unified Modeling Language (?)
- User Action - System Response Model (I like this)
  -> 2 column chart
- Minimum, show just user actions with substeps

## Modeling content

### Before you start:
- Have the task model, steps mapped out first
- Task content models

### Concept and Reference Topics
- Identify where this information is need inside of your task model.
- Map them to the tasks that they support
- We won't be focusing on the concept and reference topics in this course.
- Do this in a way that does not disrupt the task flow
  - High-level concepts children of high-level tasks
- Organize reference topics based on importance to user and frequency of use
  - essential, complex, difficult
  - "overview topics" (is this still a reference?)
  - All the reference material goes at the bottom

## From Thursday meeting

### General comments

- Attach a pdf if you can't get an image to embed
- Use case model shows the relationship between use cases
- Hierarchy (task list) or image (use case model) are acceptable (both in example),
- Content Model  - has a hierarchy and is also visual, includes tasks as well as reference and concepts.
  - highest level: Use cases? Or super-tasks?

>> Spaghetti behind it: shows all of the content

- Allows a way to show the interconnected, hyperlinked relationship between content chunks

>> As Tech Writers, we don't want to start with the content. Stop thinking about product, and think about user. These are the task list and use cases. Content model is about what we are actually going to write

- Single task == single use case, distinct from steps

>> We don't want to break stuff down to a level that appears patronizing

- Anything that is a number should be a step

- No use cases for Process model. Typically they describe interaction (most often software), want to keep users inside of the bounding box of the description of the process

>> How the tool supports the process is ancillary

- What are things you could only do with a tool (that's what we want to avoid with process)
   - Take a step back and talk about what this person is trying to accomplish (trying to make sure that no one else steps on their writing)
