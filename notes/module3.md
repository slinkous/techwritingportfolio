
## Vocabulary

- task list
- task flow
- use case
- use-case model
- content model

## Use Cases

### How to model a task?
- flowcharts
- workflow models
- data flow diagrams

 ### Scenarios vs. Use Cases
  - They are a detailed breakdown of the former

### What are they for?

- Not intended for end-user content
- "One way" that a process can take place
- Narrative description, but not paragraph.
- one complete and meaningful interaction between user and user role and the system.

### Deriving from a Scenario

- Map them from the list of tasks listed that the user needs to be able to do
- Some tasks are subtasks of a larger one

### Task/Use Case Model/Map

- Visual Diagram of tasks with actor
- Unified Modeling Language (?)
- User Action - System Response Model (I like this)
  -> 2 column chart
- Minimum, show just user actions with substeps

## Modeling content

### Before you start:
- Have the task model, steps mapped out first
- Task content models

### Concept and Reference Topics
- Identify where this information is need inside of your task model.
- Map them to the tasks that they support
- We won't be focusing on the concept and reference topics in this course.
- Do this in a way that does not disrupt the task flow
  - High-level concepts children of high-level tasks
- Organize reference topics based on importance to user and frequency of use
  - essential, complex, difficult
  - "overview topics" (is this still a reference?)
  - All the reference material goes at the bottom
