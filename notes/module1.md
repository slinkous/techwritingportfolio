> Esentially, observing users with the product, individually and with large data sets. Seems very anthropological

- Empathy mapping

> Broad categories of types of experience on which to organize user interview data, like axes. Allows you to define user personas and stories

- Focus groups
- Customer feedback
- Surveys
- Interviews

## Debrief Process

Idea: Get lots of feedback for project assignments


Share on Wednesday
Comment by end of day Thursday and Respond to Discussion
Debrief on Thursday at 3 (Unless traveling)
Comment on classmate's discussion responses on Friday
Gives you Friday and Saturday to post assignments

**Fourth of July will be vacation week**


Helps us to learn by seeing lots and lots of examples for assignments

Fine if you can't see debrief live, but will be posted, same day or next morning

In debriefs, don't call out every single problem or positive, but makes some comments to help us all get an idea, but if several people make the same mistake, will list it as a general trend. In general, worthwhile for you to watch feedback for others as well as your own.

**Check the example documents** - contain format, and good practices
There will always be an example that is complete up to the point we are working on that week.
Content of these is deliberately simple, and not as thorough as our writing will be.


Try really hard not to overthink this. Sharing the drafts on Wednesday, just "jump off the cliff". Goal is to create as much of a "real world" experience as possible.

Requirements: What are the things this person would need to be successful

Process: A methodology for everyone to follow - having a consistent system across a company

Can involve a product, but needs to not focus on the individual tasks of using the product, but generally the process.
