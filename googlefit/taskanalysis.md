## Overview

### Product: Google Fit Android App

> I will be writing about the Google Fit App for Android. I will be using the [help articles](https://support.google.com/fit/) as well as the [developer documentation](https://developers.google.com/fit/overview) for reference.

### Feature: Activity Recording.

> The features covered in this guide will be those that involve manual record-keeping of activities, live activity tracking, and the passive tracking done by the android device motion sensor.

### Audience: Casual, non-technical users of the app.

> This guide is intended for casual, non-technical users who have already installed the app, and are not solely interested in using it with a fitness tracking wearable.

### User Goals:
- Manually add exercise activities to Google Fit records
- Track an activity as it is being performed
- Review past activities

### Style Guide: Google Documentation Style Guide

> I will be using the [Google Documentation Style Guide](https://developers.google.com/style/). Although it is primarily intended for developer-facing documentation, it in creates standards of simplicity, clarity, and international accessibility that apply equally to user-facing writing.
