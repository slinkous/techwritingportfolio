## Style

### General Intentions

The two goals of this writing are to be modular, and task-driven. The central documents are the task instructions, and references and explanations are intended to enhance the experience of performing these tasks.

### Style Guide: Google Documentation Style Guide

This guide will use the [Google Documentation Style Guide](https://developers.google.com/style/). Although it is primarily intended for developer-facing documentation, it creates standards of simplicity, clarity, and international accessibility that apply equally to user-facing writing.
