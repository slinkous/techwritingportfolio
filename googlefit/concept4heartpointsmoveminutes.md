# Heart Points and Move Minutes

Both Heart Points and Move Minutes are based on the number of minutes you spend doing an activity, and are aggregated to see if you are reaching defined activity minimums over a particular period of time. The primary difference between them is that Heart Points are only generated when an activity is of the type that will elevate your heart rate. For example, meditation will give you Move Minutes, but not Heart Points

## Heart Points

Heart Points are a measure based on the recommendations of the American Heart Association. They will be awarded for activities considered active when those activities are tracked manually or live. For passive activity tracking, they are awarded when you move the equivalent of 30 steps per 60 seconds.

## Move minutes

Move minutes are awarded for each whole minute that you are active, in any activity type. This can be any variety of activities, and is not limited to ones where you are strictly moving.
