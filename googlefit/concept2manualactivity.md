# Manual activity tracking

You can record activities without any sensor data in the Google Fit App. This is ideal for fitness classes, and any situation in which you would not want to carry your smart phone or wear a fitness tracking device.

Google Fit will base the calories, effort level, steps, and other relevant metrics on the type of activity you select for the record, but they can also [be changed](task2changemetrics.html). GPS data, however, cannot be added, nor can a manually-added activity start or end in the future.
