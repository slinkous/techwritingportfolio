# Live Activity Tracking

You can begin tracking an activity at the moment you start it, and pause and resume as much as you want during the activity to create a new activity record. The calories, distance, and another metrics will be generated once you stop the activity.

While any type of activity can be used to start a live activity, certain activities such as biking and walking can also use the GPS to generate a map and more precise measure of the distance traveled.
