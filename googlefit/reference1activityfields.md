# Activity Fields

Activities that are recorded through the Google Fit app have a number of fields that you can customize to add detail to the record keeping of your fitness journal. Some of these will be just for your reference, while others affect the calculated Move Minutes and Heart Points that each activity yields. The table below explains each field, and the parameters that they affect.

<table>
  <tr>
    <th>Field</th>
    <th>Optional</th>
    <th>Heart Points</th>
    <th>Description</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Activity Type</td>
    <td>No</td>
    <td>Yes</td>
    <td>This field is simply denoted by a symbol representing the activity and the name. It contains a variety of different sports and exercises, but you may find that you need to use a similar activity when the specific activity you are doing is not available.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Date</td>
    <td>No</td>
    <td>No</td>
    <td>This field allows you to change the date of the activity in question. It can only be the current date, or an earlier one.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Start</td>
    <td>No</td>
    <td>No</td>
    <td>This field will be the time that the activity starts. In a live activity it will be the moment that you press start, and with manually tracked activities it will default to an hour before the time that the activity is created.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>End</td>
    <td>No</td>
    <td>Yes</td>
    <td>This field will be the time that the activity is ended. In a live activity it will be the moment that you press stop, and with manually tracked activities it will default to the current time. It determines the total duration of the activity.</td>
    </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Activity title</td>
    <td>Yes</td>
    <td>No</td>
    <td>This field allows you to name the activity. This can be particularly useful when you are using a similar activity type to represent an unlisted activity type. If no title is given, the title will denote the time of day ("Morning," "Lunch", "Afternoon", "Evening", or "Late Night") and the Avtivity type</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Notes</td>
    <td>Yes</td>
    <td>No</td>
    <td>This field allows you to add any additional info about an activity.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Effort Level</td>
    <td>Yes</td>
    <td>Yes</td>
    <td>This field lets you use a slider to denote how physically challenging an activity is. This will directly correlate to the number of <a href="concept4heartpointsmoveminutes.html">Heart Points</a> the activity gives per minute</a>, ranging from 0 to 2 Heart Points per minute. If you do not specify it, the effort level will be based on the Activity type.</td>
