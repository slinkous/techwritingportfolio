# Passive Activity Tracking

Google Fit will create records of your fitness activities even when you do not  create those records yourself, and add those records to the journal.  

This passive tracking relies on requests for sensor data from your smart phone, that uses calculations of motion to function like a pedometer. The data is always being recorded, and updates periodically on the app. This data can come from multiple sources, like a fitness tracking wristband, and Fit will select the source that is most likely to be accurate.

These activities are usually recorded as a "walk", but may also be categorized as a "run" or "bike", based on the speed recorded during the activity.

Because these activities are generated, you can not change some aspects of the activity, like the time and duration, but other details of the activity [can be edited normally](task5editactivty.html).
