# Project: Process Instructions

## Process: Version Control in Technical writing

Git is a system of version control that preserves a timeline of edits of a file in a line-by-line format with comments and authorship, similar to systems used in Microsoft Word and Google Docs. GitHub and GitLab are repository websites that allow online storage of a project for collaboration, similar to a cloud storage system.

## Audience

While the users of version control tend to be developers, the goal of this project is to make these tools accessible to writers who do not have software development experience, but will likely be collaborating with programmers.

## Purpose

The goal of this instruction is to make a commonly used resource available to technical writers to allow more streamlined participation in software projects. It focuses on using repositories as writing projects alone, but would also build the skills that allow developers to make in-line edits to software comments in projects that generate documentation automatically.

## Requirements

- Essentials of Git, command-line and GUI (Atom for examples)
- Feature branches and workflow 
- Pull Requests
