          <p>Activities that are recorded through the Google Fit app have a number of fields that you can customize to add detail to the record keeping of your fitness journal. Some of these will be just for your reference, while others affect the calculated Move Minutes and Heart Points that each activity yields. The table below explains each field, and the parameters that they affect.</p>
          <table>

              <th>Field</th>

              <td>Yes</td>
              <td>This field is simply denoted by a symbol representing the activity and the name. It contains a variety of different sports and exercises, but you may find that you need to use a similar activity when the specific activity you are doing is not available.</td>

If no title is given, the title will denote the time of day (&quot;Morning,&quot; &quot;Lunch&quot;, &quot;Afternoon&quot;, &quot;Evening&quot;, or &quot;Late Night&quot;) and the Avtivity type</td>

            <td>Yes</td>
            <td>This field lets you use a slider to denote how physically challenging an activity is. This will directly correlate to the number of <a href="concept4heartpointsmoveminutes.html">Heart Points</a> the activity gives per minute</td>, ranging from 0 to 2 Heart Points per minute. If you do not specify it, the effort level will be based on the Activity type.
