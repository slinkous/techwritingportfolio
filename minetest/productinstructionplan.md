# Project: Product Instructions

## Product: Minetest Modding API

[Minetest](https://www.minetest.net/) is a open-source voxel game with close similarities to the more widely known [Minecraft](https://www.minecraft.net/). One of the most important differences from Minecraft is that Minetest is designed inherently for users not just to play, but to also program and share their own modifications. This is made possible by a modding API, and my intention is to create instructions

## Audience

Because Minetest is a videogame, its userbase varies in age widely, from people as young as 8 to the tech-savvy middle-aged. I would assume, based on my experience with Minecraft, that it also skews primarily male, but don't have data on Minetest in particular, as it is much more obscure. Because of its "sandbox" style play, it appeals to both the very mathematically-minded as well as more creatively-oriented users. Finally, because of its dual purpose as a playable game and a game-making engine, its users are all somewhat technical, varying all the way to extremely experienced programmers.

## Purpose

The purpose of this instruction (and here is where I am not clear on how I will make a distinction between the product and a particular procedure) is to allow the technically enthusiastic to immediately begin to use this product to code and modify.

This product has great educational potential, but the existing documentation lacks contextualization, and usability by the beginner, except for one: the [Minetest Modding Book](https://rubenwardy.com/minetest_modding_book/)

## Requirements

- Download a mod from a repository and create a game that uses it
- Create the essential mod files in the correct location to be usable in the game.
- Create a basic custom node block with some but not all more advanced features
- Create a custom item.
- Create custom behavior using event callbacks.

## Scenario

Charles is a high school student with experience playing Minecraft, who is also taking basic computer science classes, which are taught primarily in Python. He wants to learn to create his own game objects in a free program, mostly imitating Minecraft YouTubers that he once followed. He will need to understand how to scale his ideas to the available tools, how to create a file in a directory that makes it testable, and try out a mod in the game.


## Users and roles model

| User/job title | Role Description |
| -------------- | -------------- |
| Student Programmer | Has programming and gaming experience, but likely not with this game or programming language. Will need an introductory guided tutorial and resources on how to pursue a wider variety of goals following the initial step |
| Computer Science Instructor | Teaches younger students how to program, and needs a free, open resource to teach programming in a more tangible context. Needs to understand how to use the program, and create further lessons that both cover essential concepts and are interesting to students |
