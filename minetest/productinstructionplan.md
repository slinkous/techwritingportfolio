# Project: Product and Process Instructions

## Product: Minetest Modding API

[Minetest](https://www.minetest.net/) is a open-source voxel game with close similarities to the more widely known [Minecraft](https://www.minecraft.net/). One of the most important differences from Minecraft is that Minetest is designed inherently for users not just to play, but to also program and share their own modifications. This is made possible by a modding API, and my intention is to create instructions

## Audience

Because Minetest is a videogame, its userbase varies in age widely, from people as young as 8 to the tech-savvy middle-aged. I would assume, based on my experience with Minecraft, that it also skews primarily male, but don't have data on Minetest in particular, as it is much more obscure. Because of its "sandbox" style play, it appeals to both the very mathematically-minded as well as more creatively-oriented users. Finally, because of its dual purpose as a playable game and a game-making engine, its users are all somewhat technical, varying all the way to extremely experienced programmers.

## Purpose

The purpose of this instruction (and here is where I am not clear on how I will make a distinction between the product and a particular procedure) is to allow the technically enthusiastic to immediately begin to use this product to code and modify.

This product has great educational potential, but the existing documentation lacks contextualization, and usability by the beginner, except for one: the [Minetest Modding Book](https://rubenwardy.com/minetest_modding_book/)

## Requirements

Not sure what this means.
